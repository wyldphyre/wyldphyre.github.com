title: An Introduction To Slayer

Like so many handy utility applications, Slayer is something I created to scratch my own itch. It makes it easy for me to kill processes that I find myself needing to kill on a regular or semi-regular basis. I could do what it does by hand, but this saves me time and annoyance.

##  Background
My work as a Windows developer means that I not infrequently find myself needing to kill a process that may have stopped responding or won't close properly. We already had a simple tool to do this at work, but it was very basic and brute force, as it would kill all instances of a process, based on the executable path. I found that didn't work well for me, because I might often have multiple instances of an application running and I would rarely want to kill all instances. So I built my own improved (in my mind at least) version of an application killer. The old app was called *Killer*, so I called my app *Slayer*!

# What does it do?
The primary goal of Slayer is to provide a simple user interface in the scenario where I want to kill an application which has more than one instance running. In that case, the UI will allow me to quickly kill only the process I want to kill, leaving the other process(es) to continue running uninterrupted. The functionality set has expanded a little, from that initial goal, but it still maintains that focus.
