I recently got it into my head that I should try to write about the personal coding projects that I occasionally get up to in my spare time.

I guess I've two main reasons for starting this blog:

- I'd like to document the projects and the things I learn a bit better.
- It gives me a chance to work on my documentation and explanation skills.

Post aren't likely to be frequent, as my personal projects tend to happen in bursts, and are never typically all that large in scope.

My projects can be found on [Github](http://www.github.com/wyldphyre/). It's an eclectic assortment, mostly small scripts. I'm afraid I tend to lack for big ideas. I like to scratch my own itches as they arise, and there's something to be said for a nice bit of simple automation to make ones life easier.
