This is a perfect example of a situation where I had a personal annoyance and create a solution to scratch my itch.

# What it does
when you are viewing a book on the goodreads website you can trigger this bookmarklet and it will open an Amazon search in a new tab, using the title and author of the book you were looking at.

# Why i made it
I created this bookmarklet because after several times finding myself on the [Goodreads website](http://www.goodreads.com) and wanting to look up a book on Amazon. but good reads doesn't have any way that I coukd find to directly search for a book on Amazon. You would have to to open an Amazon page and search yourself, entering booking information by hand in order to perform a search. After doing this a number of times I found that it was more annoyance than I was willing to put up with, so after a small amount of effort that I put together this bookmarklet.
