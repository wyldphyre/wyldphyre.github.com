My name is Craig Reynolds. Since 2001 I've worked as an application developer for [Kestral Computing](www.kestral.com.au). The focus, the the early days, was on a pathology lab system software, but since about 2005 I've spent most of my time working on our [Karisma](http://www.kestral.com.au/products-Karisma.html) radiology software.

In my spare time I occasionally work on a personal application or knock up a script of some sort to scratch an itch that is annoying me. Nothing fancy, but I find them both handy and cool.
